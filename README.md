# crypto-hodl-py
Python repository for my project involving gathering data for crypto and running scenarios




## Todo - I wrote this in 10 minutes.
- Build out basic environment to download data and define data schema
    -csv files, CSV FILES EVERYWHERE
- Build out investment/hodl(not to be confused with trading) algorithm
- Build out portfolio simulation tool
    - Initial
    - DCA
    - Buy signal
    - You should really sell signal
    - Consistent relative comparison to market /similar size caps as a whole
    - ranking movement tracking

- Stats im interested in
    - Top 10,50, 200 to total market cap
- Migrate code to Azure 
    - Migrate to Azure Cosmos DB
    - .Net core
- Build super robust alerting system
    - I literally have no clue how this will NOT be computationally expensive to run
    - As far as I know, nothing like this exists on the market


### Todo - the very far future if I decide this is useful 
- Figure out how to make website 
    - make sure mobile development is basically down in tandem
    -payment system
        - Figure out payment architecture
            - probably based on services/endpoint at different usage rates (is the most fair imo, similar to crypto watch in a way)
        - Figure out what system to use
    - user system
    - user security

- Desktop application

- Have a melt down as I'm basically running my own business at this point and try to sell.

### Todo - Marketing
- Put my money where my mouth is. If I'm selling you this, I'm sure as hell going to be using it.
